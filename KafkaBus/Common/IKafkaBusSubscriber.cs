        //Consider omittting the Started events so only Succeeded/Failed/Lost events are exposed

        //Consider passing the error message in ConnectionFailure to the event (also for Lost events if there is any exception)
        //Consider exposing a dictionary like event interface where individual events can be subscribed to/unsubscribed from
        //so that new events can be added without modifying the interface. -- If so make the events discoverable.
